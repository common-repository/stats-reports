Requires at least: 2.1
Tested up to: 5.0

== Description ==

This plugin is no longer maintained as it became obsolete at the same time as <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/stats/">WordPress.com Stats</a>. This plugin was replaced by Jetpack, which includes a Blog Stats Widget. Other plugins cover the other functions (most searched, most viewed). 
If you're looking for something similar, feel free to contact us at <a href="https://www.fluenx.com/">Fluenx, e commerce solutions</a>. We work mostly on WordPress and WooCommerce.

Since this plugin kept working for 9+ years without any update, I'm leaving it as a testimony to the durability of WordPress core code.

Use this plugin to display stats from WordPress.com stats plugin.

You need <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/stats/">WordPress.com Stats</a> plugin to use this plugin. This plugin only displays stats from WordPress.com
